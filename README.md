# Cultural Genocide - A Global Perspective

This project seeks to first map the occurrence of Cultural Genocide around the world by drawing on a novel dataset of states' attempts to erase cultures and identities within their borders since 1945, compiled as part of the [ETHNICGOODS](https://ethnicgoods.org/about/) project.

Work in progress - with Dr. Emre Amasyali and Dr. Andrei Tarasov.
